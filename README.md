Caesar Cipher Implementation
This Java project provides a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions based on the given key.

Features
Encryption: Encrypt any message by shifting each letter by a specified key.
Decryption:
Decrypt a message using the known key.
Brute-force decryption to test all possible keys and display the decrypted messages.
Encryption Example
Choose the encryption option.
Enter the message you want to encrypt.
Provide the encryption key (an integer).
The program will display the encrypted message.
Decryption Example
Choose the decryption option.
You can either:
Enter the known decryption key to get the original message.
Choose the brute-force option to display all possible decrypted messages.
